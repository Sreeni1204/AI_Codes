A* Search algorithm:

Manhattan heuristics: 

initial configuration - puzzle_8 = [1, 5, 7, 3, 6, 2, 0, 4, 8]
goal configuration - goal = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
steps for reaching the goal: 4311
number of visited nodes: 10998
time taken: 6.92s

Misplaced tiles heuristics:

initial configuration - puzzle_8 = [1, 5, 7, 3, 6, 2, 0, 4, 8]
goal configuration - goal = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
steps for reaching the goal: 2978
number of visited nodes: 7884
time taken: 3.49s

Greedy Search algorithm:

Manhattan heuristics: 

initial configuration - puzzle_8 = [1, 5, 7, 3, 6, 2, 0, 4, 8]
goal configuration - goal = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
steps for reaching the goal: 212
number of visited nodes: 546
time taken: 0.02s

Misplaced tiles heuristics:
